Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. **Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher**. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can only take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available and they cannot start eating before getting both forks.

Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

哲学家用餐问题由 Edsger Dijkstr 在 1965年 提出, 是一个非常经典的并发问题. 核心需要解决下面的问题

- 死锁(deadlock): 所有的哲学家都在等待其他人放在叉子
- 活锁(livelock): 资源被耗尽。比如一个哲学家拿到一个叉子之后, 必须要等待10分钟或者更久的事件, 才拿到另外一个叉子。

也可以理解为 Liveness(存活性) 和 Fairness(公平性) 的问题.

如果从一个正常的思维角度来看的话, 我理解是解决下面的一个问题

    如何让每个哲学家在最短的等待时间内用餐

这样就要求不能有 死锁, 也不能有活锁(不能造成锁超时)

## 线程和锁
Java, C 等, 都支持原始的 Thread 和 Lock, 该部分理解起来会比较复杂, 更接近于硬件的设计, 也是所有的并发编程模型的基础.

下面是使用 [syncronized](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/syncmeth.html) 来解决
